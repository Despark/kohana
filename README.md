### Kohana project template for Composer

This is how we bootstrap a Kohana project.

#### Creating a new project

To create a project named `foobar`, just run:
``` bash
composer create-project despark/kohana foobar 
```

That's it! You now have a Kohana project with some important modules installed, CLI tools, permissions set up and more!
